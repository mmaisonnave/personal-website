 graduate seminars have a common theme: students read papers prior to 
class and then discuss them in class. Often, one student is asked to 
initiate the discussion by describing a paper and posing some initial 
discussion questions. Below are some suggestions for how to initiate 
discussions.</p><p><b>Be succinct</b> -- Class time is limited.  Your 
goal is to begin discussion, not to substitute for it.  In general, you 
shouldn't take more than 3-5 minutes.  Spend about 75% of your time 
describing the paper, then spend the remaining time on two or three 
questions.</p><p><b>Don't repeat what the author says</b> -- Everyone 
has read the article, and there is no reason to repeat what the author 
has already said.  Particularly if your grade depends on how well you 
initiate discussion, you may have a strong desire to be expansive, 
summarizing all the major points of each section in the authors own 
words.  Resist this impulse.</p><p><b>Provide an "outside perspective"</b>
 -- Instead of recapitulating the author's points or organization, 
provide an alternative way of looking at the paper.  This will help 
other members of the class see the paper in a different way and improve 
the discussion.  Try to move beyond the author's perspective, and cast 
the topics of the paper in a new light based on ideas and information 
not necessarily contained in the paper.</p><p><b>Compare and contrast with other papers</b>
 -- Use the context provided by other papers discussed in prior classes.
  Consider how the work in the current paper is similar or different, 
better or worse.</p><p><b>Prepare ahead of time</b> -- First, read the 
paper and note the major themes that you think best characterize the 
paper.  Second, review the paper again and try to move beyond the paper.
  What doesn't the author consider?  Are the experiments or arguments 
conclusive?  What are the limits of the paper's conclusions?  What lies 
beyond those limits?  Third, reinterpret and reorganize the themes of 
the paper in the light of your review. </p><p><b>Hit the high points</b> -- In your description and questions, hit the most comprehensive themes.  Save minor points for later in the discussion.</p><p><b>Be provocative</b>
 -- The goal of your comments and questions is to stimulate discussion, 
not necessarily to provide a balanced summary.  If you disagree with the
 thesis of paper or if you think the authors missed something, say so.  
Consider asking questions that identify two or more extreme positions 
and then asks where the paper lies in that space.  For example, you 
might ask: "Smith's algorithm can be viewed as either a trivial 
recombination of known statistical principles or an innovative and 
elegant approach that supercedes all previous work.  Which is it?"  
Finally, consider taking an opposing view (even if you don't agree with 
it) as a method of encouraging discussion.</p><p><b>Make notes</b> -- 
Make some notes about what you want to say in class.  Don't write out 
all of what you will say, but do note the important points and your 
questions so you won't forget them when you present in class.</p><p><b>Practice</b>
 -- After you make your notes, practice your comments once or twice.  
This will only take 10 minutes, it will improve your delivery, and it is
 the best way to check if you will stay within your target time (3-5 
minutes).</p></td></tr></tbody></table></center></body></html>
