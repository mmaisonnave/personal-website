  <strong>Specific Example: NIPS Review Criteria</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong> -- Is the paper technically sound? Are claims well-supported? 
  Is this a complete piece of work, or merely a ``position paper''? Are the authors 
  careful (and honest) about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the 
  work. <br>
  <strong>Clarity</strong> -- Is the paper clearly written? Is it well-organized 
  (if not, feel free to make suggestions to improve the manuscript)? Does it adequately 
  inform the reader? (A superbly written paper provides enough information for 
  the expert reader to reproduce the results.) <br>
  <strong>Originality</strong> -- Are the problems or approaches new? Is this 
  a novel combination of familiar techniques? Is it clear how this work differs 
  from previous contributions? Is related work adequately referenced? <br>
  <strong>Significance</strong> -- Are the results important? Does the paper address 
  a difficult problem in a better way than previous research? Does it advance 
  the state of the art? Does it provide unique data, unique conclusions on existing 
  data, or a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach?</p>
